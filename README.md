## Deploy to GitHub Pages (quick)
1. Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g. `el-portfolio`).
2. Push this project (see commands below).
3. In GitHub Settings → Pages → select `main` branch and `/ (root)` as source → Save.
4. Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` (or at your custom domain if you add a CNAME).

# in project root
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit — el portfolio"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
